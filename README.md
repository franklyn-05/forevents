# 4Events
4Events is an app that allows you to directy book events to see your favourite artist, while also seeing who all your friends and family are seeing soon. It aims to bring an even more social feel to concerts/events as it will also allow you to follow people on the app, forming friendships with people who share your same taste, breaking the barrier for those who miss out on events because they have no one to go with.

## Motivation
This app was created as a fun way for me to further understand Django fundamentals and how the stack works. I got to experience developing the front end as well as the back end which I hadn't fully got to do before.

## Current Status
As this app was mainly a refresher for me to deepen my understanding of Django fundamentals after doing a Django group project, which didnt allow me to experience using certain aspects, I am not currently developing it at the moment. I do enjoy the idea so may choose to develop further in the future, as there were many ideas I had for it, seeing as it is still at a very early stage of it's development.
